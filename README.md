# Imaging-Scripts

The intent of the scripts contained in this Repository is to surface common document image manipulation routines for
manipulation with PowerShell. PowerShell, or PowerShell Workflow will be the defacto intermiediate language of all
future Windows automation engines. Recognizing, classifying, and extracting data from documents in their raw image 
using PowerShell and/or PowerShell Workflow is a valuable function.
